# Firebase App Initialization Failure
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when initializing a Firebase app. The issue is that the app fails to initialize despite having apparently correct configuration values.
## Bug Description
The `initializeApp` function from the Firebase JavaScript SDK fails to initialize the app, throwing an error.  This happens even when the `firebaseConfig` object appears to contain the correct API key, auth domain, and other necessary settings.
## Solution
The problem is often related to an incorrect or missing Firebase project setup, a problem with the configuration object itself, or a mismatched version of the Firebase library and the backend setup. This fix involves double-checking various components of your Firebase setup.
